# Real-Time-FaceDetection
A program is developed in MATLAB using viola-jones algorithmwhich is able to recognize the faces of people in real-time and also creates a database is created of the people.

Data_creation_and_face_detection is the main program takes a snapshot in the beginning and is saved in the default Matlab folder, later on the face is detected with the help of computer visiion toolbox.

It is essentia to have the CascadeObjectDetector open parallely while running the main program.

CascadeObjectDetector is the program which has the viola jones algorithm in it which can determine the various aspects such as nose,eyes face and upper body,however for our project we have used only the face determination.

The following program has an accuracy of over 82% and it was also able to recognise my pet's face also,so the program can also be used for pet animals recognition.
